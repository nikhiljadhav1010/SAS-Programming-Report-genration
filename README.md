# Project heavy weight 1.sas
The provided SAS code first imports data from Excel files (HIST.xlsx, STAT.xlsx, and STUDHT.xlsx) into SAS datasets, processes and merges the data, calculates BMI and weight in kilograms and height in meters, classifies BMI into different statuses, and generates a pie chart based on the BMI status.
# Project heavy weight 2.sas
In order to calculate BMI, weight in kilogrammes, and height in metres, the provided SAS code first imports data from Excel files (HIST.xlsx, STAT.xlsx, and STUDHT.xlsx) into SAS datasets. It then processes and merges the data, classifies BMI into various statuses, and creates a frequency table by gender and BMI status.
# Project heavy weight 3.sas
The provided SAS macro, %myStat(var1, var2), generates a frequency analysis and report for two categorical variables, STATUS and gender, from the class_merged dataset. It calculates frequencies, percentages, and other statistics for the cross-tabulation of these variables and creates a transposed report.
